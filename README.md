MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION WITH ADABOOST ALGORITHM USING ONE-VS-ALL TECHNIQUE

Thesis of Bachelor's degree on West Pomeranian University of Technology.

Purpose of this work is extending capabilities of AdaBoost classification to make it able to handle multiclass datasets. 
In basic version AdaBoost is algorithm which classifying binary. 
Usage Ove-Vs-All technique and shown in article, weak classifiers weights modification let classifying multiclass data. 
In order to verify three weak classifiers were chosen and implemented. 
Each of them was tested on three chosen datasets with different amount of class, samples and attributes. 
Work shows results of classifiers accuracy, with and without use of boost.
